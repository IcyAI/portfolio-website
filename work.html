        <img src="img\Achievment-4.png" class="work-images" alt="picture of meet app in the browser">
        <p>
         The objective was to build a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) with React using a
         test-driven development (TDD) technique. The application uses the Google
         Calendar API to fetch upcoming events. </p>

         <p> 
            The goal of the app is to display different events going on in cities around the world. The user can sort the events by city
            and the number of events displayed. Each event has a description and the website offers two types of charts that display data about
            the events. The app can also be downloaded as a PWA from the browser.
         </p>

         <p> Technologies used: Vscode, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Recharts, Amazon Web Services Lambda, Google Calandar API, Google OAuth, Unit Tests, Inegration Tests, Acceptance Tests, End to End Tests, PWA Functionality, User Stories, Test Scenarios, GitHub, GitHub pages</p>
